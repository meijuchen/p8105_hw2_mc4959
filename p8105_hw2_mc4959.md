## Problem 1

Read and clean the Mr. Trashwheel dataset.

``` r
trashwheel_df = 
  read_xlsx(
    "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
    sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel",
    range = cell_cols("A:N")) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  drop_na(dumpster) %>%
  mutate(
    sports_balls = round(sports_balls),
    sports_balls = as.integer(sports_balls)
  )
```

Read and clean precipitation data for 2018 and 2017.

``` r
precip_2018 = 
  read_excel(
    "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
    sheet = "2018 Precipitation",
    skip = 1,
  ) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  drop_na(month) %>%
  mutate(year = 2018) %>%
  relocate(year)

precip_2017 = 
  read_excel(
    "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
    sheet = "2017 Precipitation",
    skip = 1,
  ) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  drop_na(month) %>%
  mutate(year = 2017) %>%
  relocate(year)
```

Combine annual precipitation and convert month to a character variable.

``` r
month_df = 
  tibble(
    month = 1:12,
    month_name = month.name
  )

precip_df = 
  bind_rows(precip_2018, precip_2017)

left_join(precip_df, month_df, by = "month")
```

    ## # A tibble: 24 x 4
    ##     year month total month_name
    ##    <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <chr>     
    ##  1  2018     1  0.94 January   
    ##  2  2018     2  4.8  February  
    ##  3  2018     3  2.69 March     
    ##  4  2018     4  4.69 April     
    ##  5  2018     5  9.27 May       
    ##  6  2018     6  4.77 June      
    ##  7  2018     7 10.2  July      
    ##  8  2018     8  6.45 August    
    ##  9  2018     9 10.5  September 
    ## 10  2018    10  2.12 October   
    ## # … with 14 more rows

This dataset contains information from the Mr. Trashwheel trash
collector in Baltimore, Maryland. As trash enters inner harbor, the
trashwheel collects that trash, and stores it in the dumpster. The
dataset contains information on year, month, and trash collected,
include some specific kinds of trash. There are a total of 344 rows in
our final dataset. Additional data sheets include month precipitation
data. More info:

  - The total precipitation in 2018 was 70.33 inches.
  - The median number of sports balls found in a dumpster in 2017 was 8

## Problem 2

Read and clean the NYC Transit Dataset. Retain important variables.
Convert the entry variable to a logical variable.

``` r
nyc_subway_df = 
  read_csv(
    "./data/nyc_transit_subway_data.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  select(line:entry, vending, ada) %>% 
  mutate(entry = recode(entry, YES = "TRUE", NO = "FALSE")) %>% 
  mutate(entry = as.logical(entry))
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   .default = col_character(),
    ##   `Station Latitude` = col_double(),
    ##   `Station Longitude` = col_double(),
    ##   Route8 = col_double(),
    ##   Route9 = col_double(),
    ##   Route10 = col_double(),
    ##   Route11 = col_double(),
    ##   ADA = col_logical(),
    ##   `Free Crossover` = col_logical(),
    ##   `Entrance Latitude` = col_double(),
    ##   `Entrance Longitude` = col_double()
    ## )

    ## See spec(...) for full column specifications.

The dataset contains information of entrances and exits for each NYC
subway station. I kept some important variables, such as: line, station,
name, station latitude / longitude, routes served, entry, vending,
entrance type, and ADA compliance.

Then I cleaned the dataset, by reformatting the names, and converting
the entry variable to a logical vector(True/False). The dataset has 1868
rows by 19 columns. However, the dataset is still untidy. It contains
lots of NA values and the information of routes are spread across the
columns.

  - There are 465 distinct stations.
  - 84 stations are ADA compliant.
  - The proportion of station entrances/exits without vending allow
    entrance is 0.3770492.

Create a new dataset that tidies up the previous one, and reformat the
data so that the route number and route name are distinct variables.

``` r
tidy_subway_df =
  nyc_subway_df %>%
  mutate_at(vars(route1:route11), as.character) %>%
  pivot_longer(
    route1:route11,
    names_to = "route_name",
    names_prefix = "route",
    values_to = "route_number"
  ) %>% 
  drop_na(route_number)
```

There are 60 stations that serve the A train. Of these stations, only 17
are ADA compliant.
